In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard output,
with references to environment variables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE}
being replaced with the corresponding values.  If a SHELL\-FORMAT is given,
only those environment variables that are referenced in SHELL\-FORMAT are
substituted; otherwise all environment variables references occurring in
standard input are substituted.
.PP
When \fB\-\-variables\fR is used, standard input is ignored, and the output consists
of the environment variables that are referenced in SHELL\-FORMAT, one per line.
